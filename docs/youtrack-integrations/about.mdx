:::tip Integrations and importers are only available on the cloud version. We plan to open-source our SDKs in the near future so that the community can request or contribute integrations as needed.

Youtrack's integrations make it easy for users to connect their Workspace and projects to popular third-party tools. This enables seamless management of issues and notifications, all from within the Youtrack platform.

Rather than having to switch back and forth between different tools and interfaces, users can access and manage their third-party tools directly from within the Youtrack platform. This streamlines workflows and improves efficiency by providing a centralized hub for all project-related activities.
